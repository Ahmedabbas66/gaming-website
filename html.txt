                I don't live in any of the cities with a Riot <br>
                 office. Is there an opportunity to work remotely?
            </h3>
            <div>
                It's highly unlikely that we'll be able to consider you for a role that isn't<br><br>
                based out of one of the locations where we currently do business. If <br><br>
                you're open to relocating, please make sure to indicate that in your<br><br>
                application.​<br><br><br>

            <h3>
                I want to work at one of Riot's global offices<br><br>
                but I’m not a citizen of that country. Is that<br><br>
                possible?<br><br><br>
            </h3>
            <div>
                Working globally depends on the immigration restrictions of the relevant<br><br>
                country/region. If you apply to a role in a global office, those recruiting <br><br>
                teams will respond if they see a match.<br><br><br>

                We want applicants to think deeply about their skills and interest—and<br><br>
                how they line up with the jobs available at Riot. It's not a good sign if you<br><br>
